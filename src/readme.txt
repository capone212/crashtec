- Current tasks:	
	1) Refactoring code*
		- Use template design pattern and DI (were necessary) in platform code
		- Introduce separate classes for working with DB. It will allow 
			writing unit test without separate BD for it. Do this both for
			platform and domain code.
		 
	2) Writing unit tests* :
		- Unit test should be implemented both for domain and platform code
		
	3) Implementing symbolsmngr daemon

-------------
* See crashtec.symbolsmngr as example of design and unit-test coverage
